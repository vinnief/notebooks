# notebooks
Trying out Pluto, jupyter and hydrogen notebooks, Julia and Python. Kind of difficult to keep everything accessible and on the D:/ drive. hence a git to sync c and d drive. silly, that this is needed. but pluto wants to use c drive, and so does jupyter by default. Putting the noteboks online enables trying out Binder.
